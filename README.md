# simsig_importer
.Net Desktop Application for converting Excel simplified timetables into Simsig timetables

# Introduction
If you are creating your own timetables in [SimSig](https://www.simsig.co.uk/), the task quickly becomes onerous due to the excessive amount of UI interaction required to import a timetable that you are likely
to have developed separately in something like a spreadsheet, which can more closely mirror a working timetable document.

The motivation for this application is to provide the means to create timetables in a simple Excel spreadsheet format, which can then be imported into a SimSig format
timetable directly. Any other tweaks can be made once the timetable is imported into Simsig using the GUI since not all functions are exposed to the importer for
complexity reasons.

# Licence
This software is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 to allow you freedom to use and/or modify the software freely but with the requirement that you allow
any changes to be made available along with an equivalent licence. Note that simsig software is proprietary and licenced by Hitachi Information and Control Systems Europe Limited
to Cajon Software Ltd. I have no personal link to either Hitachi or Cajon, this is simply a hobby application developed with the knowledge of but not the official
sanction of either Hitachi or Cajon.

I will endeavour to keep this up to date with any changes to timetable formats but without any direct access to source code, I can only do this with the helpful
assistance of SimSig forum users.
